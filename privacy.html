        this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We may need to share your personal information in the following
        situations:<br>
        Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
        merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another
        company.<br>
        Other Users. When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other
        content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may
        be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. If you interact
        with other users of our Services and register for our Services through a social network (such as Facebook), your
        contacts on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity. Similarly,
        other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and
        view your profile.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
        social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we
        will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we
        receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email
        address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
        social media platform.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note
        that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
        social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use,
        and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
        for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
        law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
        your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
        information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
        protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
        risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
        under 18 years of age.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years
        of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of
        such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
        from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
        measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected
        from children under age 18, please contact us at <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a
                href="mailto:privacy@flowforms.io" target="_self">privacy@flowforms.io</a></span>.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: &nbsp;You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
        time.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
        also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact
        details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data
        protection authorities are available here: <a data-auto-recognition="true"
                                                      href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html."
                                                      target="_blank">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
        your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have
        the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
        using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
        information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Account Information</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your
        account or terminate your account, you can:<br>
        Log in to your account settings and update your user account.<br>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
        active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
        assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email
        us at <a data-auto-recognition="true" href="mailto:privacy@flowforms.io">privacy@flowforms.io</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
        preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
        currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
        to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
        specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light"
        law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of
        charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct
        marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in
        the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
        please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a
        registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post
        on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below
        and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We
        will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be
        completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">CCPA Privacy Notice</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Verification process</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts
        require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain
        information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
        may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
        We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

    <p class="text-slate-900 text-lg">We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
        information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
        information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
        verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
        information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>

        You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf
        in accordance with the CCPA.<br>
        You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an
        opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days
        from the date of the request submission.<br>
